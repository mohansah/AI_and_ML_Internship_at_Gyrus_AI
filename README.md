# AI and ML Internship at Gyrus AI

## Project Description

There are a number of industrial machines that needs to keep running continuously. Such machines are rarely stopped. Hence regular maintenance of those machines is one of the most important tasks in any Factory. However, the process is quite tedious. Everyday records have to be taken of how the machines are performing. There is not just one machine but a number of them and a number of parameters to be checked. Most of these are done manually. If the machines are not regularly monitored that might raise failures which in turn would result in huge loss for the factory owners. To reduce the workload on the workers for regular monitoring of the factory machines Predictive Maintenance came into the scene.

During the Internship, I developed
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) to recognize the traffic sign images using German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) Dataset. The motive for doing this work is to understand the concept of frame and neural network which have been used for Predictive Maintenance.
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), CNN - LSTM and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) models for 
    1. Predictive Maintenance which can be compared on the basis of accuracy and size to select the best model to predict which engine will need maintenance after 30 days using Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset.
    2. Anomaly Detection to predict whether the motor is running normally or abnormally using Gyrus Motor Dataset.
 
On visual inspection the results are found satisfactory.
